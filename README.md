## Project Introduction

This project is developed based on the [Operating System in 1,000 Lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/) tutorial, aiming to learn and build a simple RISC-V operating system.

### Current Features:
- Implemented a basic operating system (OS) as demonstrated in the tutorial.
- Provides a fundamental shell functionality for basic operations.
- Supports handling of certain system calls (syscalls).

### Future Development:
- Extend system functionality to support POSIX Thread interfaces, including but not limited to:
  - **Mutex**
  - **Condition Variables**
  - **Semaphores**
  - **Barriers**
- Address and design solutions for **Priority Inversion** issues.

This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of core operating system concepts and implementation details, applying theoretical knowledge to practical system development.
